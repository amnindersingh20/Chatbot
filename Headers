Here are the annual deductible amounts for the years 2023-2026:\\n\\n2023: $1,700 for individual / $3,400 for family\\n2024: $1,750 for individual / $3,500 for family\\n2025: $1,800 for individual / $3,600 for family\\n2026: $1,850 for individual / $3,700 for family\\n\\nThese deductibles apply to medical, mental health/substance use disorder (MH/SUD), prescription drug (Rx), and CarePlus services. It's important to note that unless otherwise specified, the annual deductible applies to covered services. This means you'll need to pay the full cost of most services up to your deductible amount before the plan starts to pay its share. However, some services, such as preventive care, may be covered without having to meet the deductible first.\", \"citations\": []}"
